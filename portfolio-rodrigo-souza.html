            <h3 class="card-title">About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience in backend development, specializing in Java and Spring Boot. Throughout my career, I have maintained legacy systems while also developing REST APIs, integrating external systems, generating reports using JasperReports, and automating processes with Spring Batch.

                I focus on problem-solving, writing clean, high-quality code, and optimizing algorithms when possible. I have a strong interest in working on scalable solutions and microservices architectures.
                
                I am always looking to learn, contribute, and add value to the projects I work on.</p>
